title: The Leipzig catalogue of vascular plants

description: | 
  The Leipzig catalogue of vascular plants provides an updated and much improved reference list 
  for all described vascular plant species globally. 
  We used ~4,500 publications, existing relevant databases and available studies on molecular phylogenetics to construct a robust reference backbone. 
  A guiding principle during the compilation of the LCVP was to avoid polyphyletic genera, which are frequent in TPL, 
  either by splitting genera (e.g. separating Goeppertia from Calathea) 
  or fusing them (e.g. Stapelia and Duvalia in Ceropegia). 
  However, we did not recombine any species name in the LCVP and in cases of unclear phylogenetic position of genera, we used the conservative (i.e. existing) name.
